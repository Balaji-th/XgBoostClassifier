# XgBoostClassifier
This project aims to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a financial product (term deposit) using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets. The solution leverages Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) and Scikit-learn for robust model building and evaluation.
